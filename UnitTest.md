## Writing testable code
Writing unit tests doesn't have to be hard.  You can make it easy for yourself if you keep
testability in mind while designing your classes and interfaces.

### Fakes and mocks
When testing a class, you often need to provide some kind of canned functionality as a replacement
for real-world behavior.  For example, rather than fetching a row from a real database, you have
a test row that you want to return.  This is most commonly performed with a fake object or a mock
object.  While the difference sounds subtle, mocks have major benefits over fakes.
